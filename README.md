# Teq::Scraper

This is a basic scraper that works on JS framework sites

## Installation

Execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Teqscaper.rb gets an array of urls
TQDB.rb runs through array of urls

```
ruby lib/teq/teqscraper.rb

If you're getting nothing as a response then you might be getting an 'are you a robot' prompt. Open a
incognito chrome and fill out the captcha.
